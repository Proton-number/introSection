## My process

This time i didn't take as much time as i'd usually do. I started with the
navigation bar and that didn't take so much time to build. The only challenging
part was the drop down menu. After reaserch i found the Popover element that can
help with that from material ui. Pretty useful tool too. The remain part was me
trying to create an animated text in which each letter of the text is animated
one after the other which took a little of my time but it all worked well.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MaterialUI]
  (https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) -[FramerMotion]
  (https://www.framer.com/motion/)

### What I learned

I learnt alot more about animating using framer motion, I got more used to
material ui and it's components especially breaking points.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on my portfolio website now using more of framer motion and
material ui to build from scratch to finish.
